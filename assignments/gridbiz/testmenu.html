                <h1>Church History - The Kirtland Temple</h1>
                <p>In December of 1832 God commanded Joseph Smith to build a temple in Kirtland, Ohio.
                Construction of the temple began in June 1833. The Prophet Joseph Smith dedicated the taple on March 27, 1836 (see D&C Section 109).
                Many Church members witnessed heavenly manifestations. Jesus Christ and Joseph Smith appeared to Joseph Smith and 
                Oliver Cowdery to accept the temple (see Doctrine & Covenants 110).</p>
                <p>Most of the members of the Church moved away from Kirtland in 1838 due to prosecution.
                The ownership of the temple was challenged. 
                The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 
                now known as the Community of Christ, gained title to the building in 1880.</p>
                <p>The Community of Christ restored this sacred place. Today this is a historic site and that can be visited</p>
